# Using Trained models for Cell Type Prediction
The code in this folder is meant to deploy trained cell embeddings, feature encodings, and cell classification models for predicting cell labels on spreadsheets.

# Requirenments
running the code requires following files and libraries:

InferSent source code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent

InferSent pre-trained model: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/infersent/infersent1.pkl

GloVe word embeddings: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Sample pre-trained CE, FE, and CL models (trained on a set of 150 annotated spreadsheets): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xs_S8kKqAsS6N_-JNbgHZnpJvLhuBHKR?usp=sharing

# How to run
Requirements need to be downloaded and their path should be passed to `predict_labels.py`. create a directory named `sample_models` in this folder (same folder as the code) and place the pre-trained CE, FE, and CL models under it.
The code gets the path to a `.xls` file and generates a json output file for predicted labels and the prediction probabilities for each sheet in the excel file.
```
usage: predict_labels.py [-h] [--file FILE] [--ce_model CE_MODEL]
                         [--fe_model FE_MODEL] [--cl_model CL_MODEL]
                         [--w2v W2V] [--vocab_size VOCAB_SIZE]
                         [--infersent_model INFERSENT_MODEL]
                         [--infersent_source INFERSENT_SOURCE] [--out OUT]

processing inputs.
